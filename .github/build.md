## Building the project

The process of building the project is very simple all you need is this:

```bash
clone https://github.com/tom-sapletta-com/github-contribution-stats-cli.git
cd github-contribution-stats-cli
sh install
sh start
```

While developing you can use -src versions they are work fine. Make will just create
Release files that have proper version number, create minified files and build emoji
css.
